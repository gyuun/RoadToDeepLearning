# DeepLearning Sample Code Repository

Welcome to my DeepLearning Repository! 
This repository is dedicated to providing sample codes and resources for those who are studying deep learning. 

In the Main project, main.py serves a neural network model on the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digit images.
